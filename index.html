				Ashesi’s core curriculum consists of courses that help students develop the ethics, innovativeness, critical thinking and communication skills necessary for a lifetime career of leadership. By teaching students to explore the connections between different information, separate the relevant from the irrelevant, question assumptions and analyse alternatives, the liberal core serves as a foundation for success and influencing the world.</p>
				<p><h3>Small class sizes, amazing professors</h3>
				Class sizes at Ashesi are kept small, because we believe the best learning takes place when students are able to have deep conversations with their classmates and professors in and out of the classroom. Our classes are full of energy, and students are encouraged to speak up, share ideas and ask critical questions.</p>
				<p>Our professors care deeply about the success of the students in their classrooms. As leading voices in their areas of expertise, students will find that professors bring strong inspiration to Ashesi’s classes.
				</p>
				<p><h3>Bachelor of Science Computer Science</h3>Ashesi’s Computer Science programme focuses not only on software design and programming, but also on empowering young people to be at the forefront of African growth by harnessing the power of technology. Students in the Computer Science programme are taken through robust foundational courses that prepare them to engage new technologies, and create software tools for African needs. </p>
				<p><h3>Bachelor of Science Management Information Systems</h3>The Management Information Systems programme at Ashesi empowers students to improve business efficiency by effectively leveraging the connections between Information Technology and the functions of business and organizational strategy. This interdisciplinary programme trains students to be managers who are uniquely prepared to lead businesses in the new knowledge economy.</p>
				<p><h3>Bachelor of Science Business Administration</h3>Ashesi’s business programme depends on the foundation set by the core liberal curriculum, and prepares students to be leaders who can recognise opportunities in the needs of society and build businesses to help solve them. The business programme takes students through global business practices, with a focus on Africa’s dynamic economy. Class projects are done in partnership with local businesses in order to help students learn practical skills through solving real-world problems.</h3>

				The office of students and community affairs encourages students to dream big. It urges students to identify those deep-down desires during their four years with us, through the liberal arts focus that runs through lecture rooms and through the spirit of inquiry that runs across the campus. To enhance student experiences, we provide housing options as part of efforts to enhance the educational experience of its students with janitorial services for all areas except student bedrooms. We make sure that students are comfortable at all times by providing backup power supply to all areas of campus and constant supply of clean potable water. We also provide recreation spaces including three lounge areas across the different student dorms and a multi-purpose court for sports activites to allow students to relax and have fun. Two cafeterias can be found at Ashesi which are open from 7 am to 8 pm, as well as two nurses running 24-hour shifts to ensure that students are in good health. There are also coin-operated wash-and-dry machines and sinks for doing laundry.</p>

				An important aspect of the campus culture is the presence of clubs and societies and activities emanating from these institutions. Clubs and societies provide avenues for students to develop stronger relationships, test out their ideas, sharpen organizational and communication skills, gain managing and leadership experience and broaden their horizons outside academic life. Each club and society is committed to upholding Ashesi’s values of scholarship, leadership and citizenship and organizes events that add to the campus culture. Ashesi Business week, the Entrepreneurship Fair, ASC Week and the ARM Pinnacle are all aspects of Ashesi campus life that resonate with past and present students and which originate from the student institutions on campus. Each year students start new clubs which helps to create a more dynamic campus. Examples of clubs include African Renaissance Movement, Chess club and Google club.</p>
